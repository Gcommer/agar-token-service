    <h1>Agar.io Token Service</h1>

    <p>
    This website provides a pooling service for Agar.io connection
    tokens. It consists of generous clients which "donate" unused
    (server, token) pairs and greedy clients which claim tokens for
    servers they want to connect to.

    This service is expected to be short lived if/when Zeach decides
    to tie tokens to the IP address which requested them. For that
    reason a "kill" message is integrated so that anyone who uses this
    service in their code can detect that agar.io has been updated in
    a way that obviates the need for this service.
