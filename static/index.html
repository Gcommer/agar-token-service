    <h1>Agar.io Token Service</h1>

    <p>
    This website provides a pooling service for Agar.io connection
    tokens. It consists of generous clients which "donate" unused
    (server, token) pairs and greedy clients which claim tokens for
    servers they want to connect to.

    <p>
    This service is expected to be short lived if/when Zeach decides
    to tie tokens to the IP address which requested them. For that
    reason a "kill" message is integrated so that anyone who uses this
    service in their code can detect that agar.io has been updated in
    a way that obviates the need for this service.

    <p>
    If you use this service please have your clients donate more
    tokens then you take :)

    If you want to help donate extra tokens:

    <p>
    <b>IMPORTANT NOTE:</b> All tokens are only accepted by Agar.io if
    they are redeemed by a client with the same User-Agent string that
    accepted them. For that reason, ALL tokens donated to this service
    should have been generated and should be used with the following
    User-Agent: <br>
    <tt>Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.3; rv:36.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/36.0</tt>

    <h2>API</h2>

    <p>
    All requests are simple HTTP GET requests to the specified URLs. CORS
    is enabled to allow requests from all hosts.

    <p>
    All of these requests return JSON objects with a `msg` field. Any API
    request may return a `msg` of "KILLED", at which point your clients
    should cease using the service.

    <h3>Status</h3>

    URL: `/status[?all]` <br>

    Returns: `{ msg: 'status', status: {...} }`<br>

    <p>
    `status` is a JSON object mapping all known servers -> number of
    available tokens.

    The query string is optional. If the query parameter "all" is
    sent, then all servers we've received tokens for will be
    returned. Otherwise, only servers with currently available tokens
    will be returned.

    <h3>Donate</h3>

    URL: `/donate?server=1.2.3.4:1234&token=asdf`<br>

    Returns: `{ msg: 'thank_you' | 'invalid_token' | 'invalid_url' }`<br>

    <p>
    'thank_you' indicates successful donation; 'invalid_url' or
    'invalid_token' signify that you sent bad data. URLs must be 4-octet
    IPv4 addresses with a port number (separated by a colon).

    <h3>Claim</h3>

    URL: `/claim?server=1.2.3.4:1234`<br>

    Returns: `{ msg: 'unavailable' | 'available' [, token: '...' ] }`<br>

    <p>
    `token` field is only set if a token for the requested server was
    available.
