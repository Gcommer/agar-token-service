    <h1>Agar.io Token Service</h1>

    <p>
    This website provides a pooling service for Agar.io connection
    tokens. It consists of generous clients which "donate" unused
    (server, token) pairs and greedy clients which claim tokens for
    servers they want to connect to.

    This service is expected to be short lived if/when Zeach decides
    to tie tokens to the IP address which requested them. For that
    reason a "kill" message is integrated so that anyone who uses this
    service in their code can detect that agar.io has been updated in
    a way that obviates the need for this service.

    <h2>API</h2>

    <p>
    All requests are simple HTTP GET requests to the specified URLs. CORS
    is enabled to allow requests from all hosts.

    <p>
    All of these requests return JSON objects with a `msg` field. Any API
    request may return a `msg` of "KILLED", at which point your clients
    should cease using the service.

    <h3>Status</h3>

    URL: `/status` <br>

    Returns: `{ msg: 'status', status: {...} }`<br>

    `status` is a JSON object mapping all known servers -> number of
    available tokens.

    <h3>Donate</h3>

    URL: `/donate?server=1.2.3.4:1234&token=asdf`<br>

    Returns: `{ msg: 'thank_you' | 'invalid_token' | 'invalid_url' }`<br>

    'thank_you' indicates successful donation; 'invalid_url' or
    'invalid_token' signify that you sent bad data. URLs must be 4-octet
    IPv4 addresses with a port number (separated by a colon).

    <h3>Claim</h3>

    URL: `/claim?server=1.2.3.4:1234`<br>

    Returns: `{ msg: 'unavailable' | 'available' [, token: '...' ] }`<br>

    `token` field is only set if a token for the requested server was
    available.
